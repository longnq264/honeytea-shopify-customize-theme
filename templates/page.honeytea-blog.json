I looked in the fridge and discovered some lemons which I paired with some freshly brewed tea and honey, the rest as they say is history. I designed the recipe for HoneyTea in my kitchen and the final recipe which you taste today, whilst certified and commercially developed, remains largely similar to the initial taste. HoneyTea takes you on a journey of excitement and simply excellent flavours.</p>",
